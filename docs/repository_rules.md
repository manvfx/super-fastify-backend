##### Repository Rules
---
- Repository is private
- Main branch is protected and all changes must go through a **Pull Request**
- Take a look at [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- Development branches must be short-lived; normally they should be retained for a day or less, created at the start of the day for specific tasks and merged at the end of the working day.
- Branch names must be descriptive, regardless of their length.
- Each commit must have a full description of all changes and reasons for changes; they may include references to tasks or issues.
- Before making a pull request, the developer must pull the main branch and merge it to ensure there are no conflicts; this means conflict resolution is the responsibility of the developer.
- Remove development branch after merging.
